It is his deeply personal odyssey in search of the elusive tune. For eight long years, Wagle would sing Bhedako Oon Jasto - to his friends, and then singers and musicians, to check if they were familiar with the tune, but to no avail. Early this year, Wagle has his calls answered. Wagle sings the song to Amrit Gurung of Nepathya. Amrit shows interest to sing the song, and requests Wagle to give him the lyrics in writing. Wagle puts forward a clause - he tells Amrit - "" Both you and me have to revisit the place where I heard this song. You need to get the feel of the local essence, and I need to know more on the people and place - to write the song."" The travel is agreed upon. Danu - the current bassist of Nepathya, follows them to observe the tunes of the Tungna. For 10 days, Nepathya (Amrit Gurung and Danu), travels with Wagle to the highland village in Langtang. A part-time filmmaker Kiran Krishna Shrestha follows the research process on the search of the song - Bhedako Oon Jasto...

Like most girls her age, she often dreamt of someday marrying, starting a family, having children around the home, and living her life the way her family had for generations- to fulfill the destiny that was her birth right as a girl born to Nepal. But through a twist in fate, evil in the form of a man named Amar wandered into her village one day and after skillfully manipulating the situation to pay into his favor, within a week, Chameli and Amar became husband and wife. With promises of great riches and security for her entire family, the arrangements were swiftly made by Chameli's unsuspecting parents. As the newly weds left Chameli's village for Amar's home in the Terai, the mystery of the world which had always lay just beyond the hills was revealed to Chameli. Like a new born experiencing the universe for the first time, her expectations of a good life with a man she had come to love, grew by the hour. While his behavior was sometimes unusual to her, she had no way of knowing the extent of the evil which loomed within. Even after departing for Mumbai, Chameli never once suspected that the things were not as they should be. There are few things more disturbing in life which compare with Amar's ultimate betrayal of Chameli. In a small back room of Kamathipura, a notorious area of Mumbai, Chameli's ultimate fate was decided forever. She was sold like an animal to the owner of the brothel for a mere $200. After being delivered to the house and told to wait, the man she had married and had come to accept as her husband never returned. After being saved from the brothel after many years, Chameli finally reached her home in village Nepal where she was banished. The story reaches a peak near the end where Chameli meets up with her ""so-called"" husband and the full fury of the injustice she had suffered comes to the surface.

With a quarter of the family members gone to work as cheap laborers, Nepal seems to have lost its self-sufficiency. From a family finance supported by money sent by a young son or husband from abroad to a society without any other means of income, there seems to be no way of knowing where the problem begins and ends. The only thing we can do is revisit the present situation of immigration, which is a result of a vicious cycle of individual danger, pain, agitation, fear, and repeated migration. It's not easy for the naive citizens of Nepal who grew up in a feudal agricultural society to delve into the capitalistic economy. What if the agency that introduced foreign employers is a fraud? What if their wage is delayed? What happens to a family without its head for years? What if the money from foreign lands is gone again? Not knowing what will happen next, the citizens of Nepal live another day chasing after the mirage of foreign laborers. Can they really find riyal?",'kesang tseten',documentary,kesangtseten
