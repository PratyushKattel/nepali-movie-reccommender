Bhedako Oon Jasto, or Like Sheep's Wool, an hour long documentary, is named after the song he first heard in a highland village north of Kathmandu. It is his deeply personal odyssey in search of the elusive tune. For eight long years, Wagle would sing Bhedako Oon Jasto - to his friends, and then singers and musicians, to check if they were familiar with the tune, but to no avail. Early this year, Wagle has his calls answered. Wagle sings the song to Amrit Gurung of Nepathya. Amrit shows interest to sing the song, and requests Wagle to give him the lyrics in writing. Wagle puts forward a clause - he tells Amrit - "" Both you and me have to revisit the place where I heard this song. You need to get the feel of the local essence, and I need to know more on the people and place - to write the song."" The travel is agreed upon. Danu - the current bassist of Nepathya, follows them to observe the tunes of the Tungna. For 10 days, Nepathya (Amrit Gurung and Danu), travels with Wagle to the highland village in Langtang. A part-time filmmaker Kiran Krishna Shrestha follows the research process on the search of the song - Bhedako Oon Jasto... Kiran with his camera becomes the 'unseen' fourth character of the film.",""

Ironically, Sherpa women have long been discouraged from climbing the powerful and daunting Everest, relegated instead to more traditional roles as homemakers or into support roles in the prestigious climbing industry of Nepal. The documentary follows the five diverse, charismatic women chosen for this historic expedition.

It is his deeply personal odyssey in search of the elusive tune. For eight long years, Wagle would sing Bhedako Oon Jasto - to his friends, and then singers and musicians, to check if they were familiar with the tune, but to no avail. Early this year, Wagle has his calls answered. Wagle sings the song to Amrit Gurung of Nepathya. Amrit shows interest to sing the song, and requests Wagle to give him the lyrics in writing. Wagle puts forward a clause - he tells Amrit - "" Both you and me have to revisit the place where I heard this song. You need to get the feel of the local essence, and I need to know more on the people and place - to write the song."" The travel is agreed upon. Danu - the current bassist of Nepathya, follows them to observe the tunes of the Tungna. For 10 days, Nepathya (Amrit Gurung and Danu), travels with Wagle to the highland village in Langtang. A part-time filmmaker Kiran Krishna Shrestha follows the research process on the search of the song - Bhedako Oon Jasto... Kiran with his camera becomes the 'unseen' fourth character of the film.",""

Like most girls her age, she often dreamt of someday marrying, starting a family, having children around the home, and living her life the way her family had for generations- to fulfill the destiny that was her birth right as a girl born to Nepal. But through a twist in fate, evil in the form of a man named Amar wandered into her village one day and after skillfully manipulating the situation to pay into his favor, within a week, Chameli and Amar became husband and wife. With promises of great riches and security for her entire family, the arrangements were swiftly made by Chameli's unsuspecting parents. As the newly weds left Chameli's village for Amar's home in the Terai, the mystery of the world which had always lay just beyond the hills was revealed to Chameli. Like a new born experiencing the universe for the first time, her expectations of a good life with a man she had come to love, grew by the hour. While his behavior was sometimes unusual to her, she had no way of knowing the extent of the evil which loomed within. Even after departing for Mumbai, Chameli never once suspected that the things were not as they should be. There are few things more disturbing in life which compare with Amar's ultimate betrayal of Chameli. In a small back room of Kamathipura, a notorious area of Mumbai, Chameli's ultimate fate was decided forever. She was sold like an animal to the owner of the brothel for a mere $200. After being delivered to the house and told to wait, the man she had married and had come to accept as her husband never returned. After being saved from the brothel after many years, Chameli finally reached her home in village Nepal where she was banished. The story reaches a peak near the end where Chameli meets up with her ""so-called"" husband and the full fury of the injustice she had suffered comes to the surface. The film was produced and directed by Ravi Baral. The film have received several international and national awards.","7.5"

It is his deeply personal odyssey in search of the elusive tune. For eight long years, Wagle would sing Bhedako Oon Jasto - to his friends, and then singers and musicians, to check if they were familiar with the tune, but to no avail. Early this year, Wagle has his calls answered. Wagle sings the song to Amrit Gurung of Nepathya. Amrit shows interest to sing the song, and requests Wagle to give him the lyrics in writing. Wagle puts forward a clause - he tells Amrit - "" Both you and me have to revisit the place where I heard this song. You need to get the feel of the local essence, and I need to know more on the people and place - to write the song."" The travel is agreed upon. Danu - the current bassist of Nepathya, follows them to observe the tunes of the Tungna. For 10 days, Nepathya (Amrit Gurung and Danu), travels with Wagle to the highland village in Langtang. A part-time filmmaker Kiran Krishna Shrestha follows the research process on the search of the song - Bhedako Oon Jasto... Kiran with his camera becomes the 'unseen' fourth character of the film.",""

Like most girls her age, she often dreamt of someday marrying, starting a family, having children around the home, and living her life the way her family had for generations- to fulfill the destiny that was her birth right as a girl born to Nepal. But through a twist in fate, evil in the form of a man named Amar wandered into her village one day and after skillfully manipulating the situation to pay into his favor, within a week, Chameli and Amar became husband and wife. With promises of great riches and security for her entire family, the arrangements were swiftly made by Chameli's unsuspecting parents. As the newly weds left Chameli's village for Amar's home in the Terai, the mystery of the world which had always lay just beyond the hills was revealed to Chameli. Like a new born experiencing the universe for the first time, her expectations of a good life with a man she had come to love, grew by the hour. While his behavior was sometimes unusual to her, she had no way of knowing the extent of the evil which loomed within. Even after departing for Mumbai, Chameli never once suspected that the things were not as they should be. There are few things more disturbing in life which compare with Amar's ultimate betrayal of Chameli. In a small back room of Kamathipura, a notorious area of Mumbai, Chameli's ultimate fate was decided forever. She was sold like an animal to the owner of the brothel for a mere $200. After being delivered to the house and told to wait, the man she had married and had come to accept as her husband never returned. After being saved from the brothel after many years, Chameli finally reached her home in village Nepal where she was banished. The story reaches a peak near the end where Chameli meets up with her ""so-called"" husband and the full fury of the injustice she had suffered comes to the surface. The film was produced and directed by Ravi Baral. The film have received several international and national awards.","7.5"

To the Sherpa people, the ethnic group legendary for their unmatched skill in mountaineering, the mountain is a holy place. Mount Everest is ""Chomolongma"" - Mother Goddess of the Universe. Ironically, Sherpa women have long been discouraged from climbing the powerful and daunting Everest, relegated instead to more traditional roles as homemakers or into support roles in the prestigious climbing industry of Nepal. The documentary follows the five diverse, charismatic women chosen for this historic expedition.

It is his deeply personal odyssey in search of the elusive tune. For eight long years, Wagle would sing Bhedako Oon Jasto - to his friends, and then singers and musicians, to check if they were familiar with the tune, but to no avail. Early this year, Wagle has his calls answered. Wagle sings the song to Amrit Gurung of Nepathya. Amrit shows interest to sing the song, and requests Wagle to give him the lyrics in writing. Wagle puts forward a clause - he tells Amrit - "" Both you and me have to revisit the place where I heard this song. You need to get the feel of the local essence, and I need to know more on the people and place - to write the song."" The travel is agreed upon. Danu - the current bassist of Nepathya, follows them to observe the tunes of the Tungna. For 10 days, Nepathya (Amrit Gurung and Danu), travels with Wagle to the highland village in Langtang. A part-time filmmaker Kiran Krishna Shrestha follows the research process on the search of the song - Bhedako Oon Jasto... Kiran with his camera becomes the 'unseen' fourth character of the film.",""

Like most girls her age, she often dreamt of someday marrying, starting a family, having children around the home, and living her life the way her family had for generations- to fulfill the destiny that was her birth right as a girl born to Nepal. But through a twist in fate, evil in the form of a man named Amar wandered into her village one day and after skillfully manipulating the situation to pay into his favor, within a week, Chameli and Amar became husband and wife. With promises of great riches and security for her entire family, the arrangements were swiftly made by Chameli's unsuspecting parents. As the newly weds left Chameli's village for Amar's home in the Terai, the mystery of the world which had always lay just beyond the hills was revealed to Chameli. Like a new born experiencing the universe for the first time, her expectations of a good life with a man she had come to love, grew by the hour. While his behavior was sometimes unusual to her, she had no way of knowing the extent of the evil which loomed within. Even after departing for Mumbai, Chameli never once suspected that the things were not as they should be. There are few things more disturbing in life which compare with Amar's ultimate betrayal of Chameli. In a small back room of Kamathipura, a notorious area of Mumbai, Chameli's ultimate fate was decided forever. She was sold like an animal to the owner of the brothel for a mere $200. After being delivered to the house and told to wait, the man she had married and had come to accept as her husband never returned. After being saved from the brothel after many years, Chameli finally reached her home in village Nepal where she was banished. The story reaches a peak near the end where Chameli meets up with her ""so-called"" husband and the full fury of the injustice she had suffered comes to the surface. The film was produced and directed by Ravi Baral. The film have received several international and national awards.","7.5"

It is his deeply personal odyssey in search of the elusive tune. For eight long years, Wagle would sing Bhedako Oon Jasto - to his friends, and then singers and musicians, to check if they were familiar with the tune, but to no avail. Early this year, Wagle has his calls answered. Wagle sings the song to Amrit Gurung of Nepathya. Amrit shows interest to sing the song, and requests Wagle to give him the lyrics in writing. Wagle puts forward a clause - he tells Amrit - "" Both you and me have to revisit the place where I heard this song. You need to get the feel of the local essence, and I need to know more on the people and place - to write the song."" The travel is agreed upon. Danu - the current bassist of Nepathya, follows them to observe the tunes of the Tungna. For 10 days, Nepathya (Amrit Gurung and Danu), travels with Wagle to the highland village in Langtang. A part-time filmmaker Kiran Krishna Shrestha follows the research process on the search of the song - Bhedako Oon Jasto... Kiran with his camera becomes the 'unseen' fourth character of the film.",""

Like most girls her age, she often dreamt of someday marrying, starting a family, having children around the home, and living her life the way her family had for generations- to fulfill the destiny that was her birth right as a girl born to Nepal. But through a twist in fate, evil in the form of a man named Amar wandered into her village one day and after skillfully manipulating the situation to pay into his favor, within a week, Chameli and Amar became husband and wife. With promises of great riches and security for her entire family, the arrangements were swiftly made by Chameli's unsuspecting parents. As the newly weds left Chameli's village for Amar's home in the Terai, the mystery of the world which had always lay just beyond the hills was revealed to Chameli. Like a new born experiencing the universe for the first time, her expectations of a good life with a man she had come to love, grew by the hour. While his behavior was sometimes unusual to her, she had no way of knowing the extent of the evil which loomed within. Even after departing for Mumbai, Chameli never once suspected that the things were not as they should be. There are few things more disturbing in life which compare with Amar's ultimate betrayal of Chameli. In a small back room of Kamathipura, a notorious area of Mumbai, Chameli's ultimate fate was decided forever. She was sold like an animal to the owner of the brothel for a mere $200. After being delivered to the house and told to wait, the man she had married and had come to accept as her husband never returned. After being saved from the brothel after many years, Chameli finally reached her home in village Nepal where she was banished. The story reaches a peak near the end where Chameli meets up with her ""so-called"" husband and the full fury of the injustice she had suffered comes to the surface. The film was produced and directed by Ravi Baral. The film have received several international and national awards.","7.5"

Wagle puts forward a clause - he tells Amrit - "" Both you and me have to revisit the place where I heard this song. You need to get the feel of the local essence, and I need to know more on the people and place - to write the song."" The travel is agreed upon. Danu - the current bassist of Nepathya, follows them to observe the tunes of the Tungna. For 10 days, Nepathya (Amrit Gurung and Danu), travels with Wagle to the highland village in Langtang.

Like most girls her age, she often dreamt of someday marrying, starting a family, having children around the home, and living her life the way her family had for generations- to fulfill the destiny that was her birth right as a girl born to Nepal. But through a twist in fate, evil in the form of a man named Amar wandered into her village one day and after skillfully manipulating the situation to pay into his favor, within a week, Chameli and Amar became husband and wife. With promises of great riches and security for her entire family, the arrangements were swiftly made by Chameli's unsuspecting parents. As the newly weds left Chameli's village for Amar's home in the Terai, the mystery of the world which had always lay just beyond the hills was revealed to Chameli. Like a new born experiencing the universe for the first time, her expectations of a good life with a man she had come to love, grew by the hour. While his behavior was sometimes unusual to her, she had no way of knowing the extent of the evil which loomed within. Even after departing for Mumbai, Chameli never once suspected that the things were not as they should be. There are few things more disturbing in life which compare with Amar's ultimate betrayal of Chameli. In a small back room of Kamathipura, a notorious area of Mumbai, Chameli's ultimate fate was decided forever. She was sold like an animal to the owner of the brothel for a mere $200. After being delivered to the house and told to wait, the man she had married and had come to accept as her husband never returned. After being saved from the brothel after many years, Chameli finally reached her home in village Nepal where she was banished. The story reaches a peak near the end where Chameli meets up with her ""so-called"" husband and the full fury of the injustice she had suffered comes to the surface. The film was produced and directed by Ravi Baral. The film have received several international and national awards.","7.5"

Now the man, who has made a career writing about others, finds himself as a character in a story. Bhedako Oon Jasto, or Like Sheep's Wool, an hour long documentary, is named after the song he first heard in a highland village north of Kathmandu. It is his deeply personal odyssey in search of the elusive tune. For eight long years, Wagle would sing Bhedako Oon Jasto - to his friends, and then singers and musicians, to check if they were familiar with the tune, but to no avail. Early this year, Wagle has his calls answered. Wagle sings the song to Amrit Gurung of Nepathya. Amrit shows interest to sing the song, and requests Wagle to give him the lyrics in writing. Wagle puts forward a clause - he tells Amrit - "" Both you and me have to revisit the place where I heard this song. You need to get the feel of the local essence, and I need to know more on the people and place - to write the song."" The travel is agreed upon. Danu - the current bassist of Nepathya, follows them to observe the tunes of the Tungna. For 10 days, Nepathya (Amrit Gurung and Danu), travels with Wagle to the highland village in Langtang. A part-time filmmaker Kiran Krishna Shrestha follows the research process on the search of the song - Bhedako Oon Jasto... Kiran with his camera becomes the 'unseen' fourth character of the film.",""

Like most girls her age, she often dreamt of someday marrying, starting a family, having children around the home, and living her life the way her family had for generations- to fulfill the destiny that was her birth right as a girl born to Nepal. But through a twist in fate, evil in the form of a man named Amar wandered into her village one day and after skillfully manipulating the situation to pay into his favor, within a week, Chameli and Amar became husband and wife. With promises of great riches and security for her entire family, the arrangements were swiftly made by Chameli's unsuspecting parents. As the newly weds left Chameli's village for Amar's home in the Terai, the mystery of the world which had always lay just beyond the hills was revealed to Chameli. Like a new born experiencing the universe for the first time, her expectations of a good life with a man she had come to love, grew by the hour. While his behavior was sometimes unusual to her, she had no way of knowing the extent of the evil which loomed within. Even after departing for Mumbai, Chameli never once suspected that the things were not as they should be. There are few things more disturbing in life which compare with Amar's ultimate betrayal of Chameli. In a small back room of Kamathipura, a notorious area of Mumbai, Chameli's ultimate fate was decided forever. She was sold like an animal to the owner of the brothel for a mere $200. After being delivered to the house and told to wait, the man she had married and had come to accept as her husband never returned. After being saved from the brothel after many years, Chameli finally reached her home in village Nepal where she was banished. The story reaches a peak near the end where Chameli meets up with her ""so-called"" husband and the full fury of the injustice she had suffered comes to the surface. The film was produced and directed by Ravi Baral. The film have received several international and national awards.","7.5"

The only thing we can do is revisit the present situation of immigration, which is a result of a vicious cycle of individual danger, pain, agitation, fear, and repeated migration. It's not easy for the naive citizens of Nepal who grew up in a feudal agricultural society to delve into the capitalistic economy. What if the agency that introduced foreign employers is a fraud? What if their wage is delayed? What happens to a family without its head for years? What if the money from foreign lands is gone again? Not knowing what will happen next, the citizens of Nepal live another day chasing after the mirage of foreign laborers. Can they really find riyal?",""

It is his deeply personal odyssey in search of the elusive tune. For eight long years, Wagle would sing Bhedako Oon Jasto - to his friends, and then singers and musicians, to check if they were familiar with the tune, but to no avail. Early this year, Wagle has his calls answered. Wagle sings the song to Amrit Gurung of Nepathya. Amrit shows interest to sing the song, and requests Wagle to give him the lyrics in writing. Wagle puts forward a clause - he tells Amrit - "" Both you and me have to revisit the place where I heard this song. You need to get the feel of the local essence, and I need to know more on the people and place - to write the song."" The travel is agreed upon. Danu - the current bassist of Nepathya, follows them to observe the tunes of the Tungna. For 10 days, Nepathya (Amrit Gurung and Danu), travels with Wagle to the highland village in Langtang. A part-time filmmaker Kiran Krishna Shrestha follows the research process on the search of the song - Bhedako Oon Jasto... Kiran with his camera becomes the 'unseen' fourth character of the film.",""

Like most girls her age, she often dreamt of someday marrying, starting a family, having children around the home, and living her life the way her family had for generations- to fulfill the destiny that was her birth right as a girl born to Nepal. But through a twist in fate, evil in the form of a man named Amar wandered into her village one day and after skillfully manipulating the situation to pay into his favor, within a week, Chameli and Amar became husband and wife. With promises of great riches and security for her entire family, the arrangements were swiftly made by Chameli's unsuspecting parents. As the newly weds left Chameli's village for Amar's home in the Terai, the mystery of the world which had always lay just beyond the hills was revealed to Chameli. Like a new born experiencing the universe for the first time, her expectations of a good life with a man she had come to love, grew by the hour. While his behavior was sometimes unusual to her, she had no way of knowing the extent of the evil which loomed within. Even after departing for Mumbai, Chameli never once suspected that the things were not as they should be. There are few things more disturbing in life which compare with Amar's ultimate betrayal of Chameli. In a small back room of Kamathipura, a notorious area of Mumbai, Chameli's ultimate fate was decided forever. She was sold like an animal to the owner of the brothel for a mere $200. After being delivered to the house and told to wait, the man she had married and had come to accept as her husband never returned. After being saved from the brothel after many years, Chameli finally reached her home in village Nepal where she was banished. The story reaches a peak near the end where Chameli meets up with her ""so-called"" husband and the full fury of the injustice she had suffered comes to the surface. The film was produced and directed by Ravi Baral. The film have received several international and national awards.","7.5"

But there is a much bigger story to be told of floods in South Florida including ancient--and future--floods. From Lake Okeechobee, to Stuart, to Belle Glade, to the Everglades, So Flo Floods tells the story of these floods and the issues surrounding where the region is going and what it will need to confront if SLR continues as anticipated. Not only is South Florida home to some of the most knowledgeable experts in the world on SLR, but also to many with related expertise that help So Flo Floods paint a picture of South Florida's economic, environmental, and political realities going forward. There are differences of opinion about what's to come and what to do about it-but not that it's here. We interview professors, mayors, writers, historians, engineers, and others and support their stories with archival and current footage, as well as animation and aerial footage captured over the past two years.",""

With a quarter of the family members gone to work as cheap laborers, Nepal seems to have lost its self-sufficiency. From a family finance supported by money sent by a young son or husband from abroad to a society without any other means of income, there seems to be no way of knowing where the problem begins and ends. The only thing we can do is revisit the present situation of immigration, which is a result of a vicious cycle of individual danger, pain, agitation, fear, and repeated migration. It's not easy for the naive citizens of Nepal who grew up in a feudal agricultural society to delve into the capitalistic economy. What if the agency that introduced foreign employers is a fraud? What if their wage is delayed? What happens to a family without its head for years? What if the money from foreign lands is gone again? Not knowing what will happen next, the citizens of Nepal live another day chasing after the mirage of foreign laborers. Can they really find riyal?",""
